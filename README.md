# FoodFriendsWebApp
## Inspiration

Whether it be your local Tims or even upbeat restaurants, it is no secret that almost all food places have food waste, a lot of which could be eaten by people who want and need it. However, due to lack of infrastructure in most restaurants for such an operation, most of that food is still thrown out at the end of the day. But what if...

## What it does

Foodfriends is a web app created to link any place with food waste to local organizations so that volunteers can go pick up the food and deliver them to "food waste centres", where that food would then be redistributed to people who need it.

## How we built it

We used React Native, Javascript, Html and CSS for the front end, and for the backend we used Flask and Google Cloud. We also used the Google Maps API (a part of google cloud) to build our map system functionality.

## Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge we ran into was the difference in timezones between members of our team, which posed a huge obstacle in terms of communication and lead to several people leaving and several new people being recruited over the course of the hackathon.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to get this app built despite all of the various changes in team members!

## What we learned

The backend devs on our team were forced to work with a bit of frontend and vice-versa, which lead to all of us discovering how truly little we know in the world of software development! Overall, I personally learnt a completely new workflow to work with my teammates, and I'm sure they did the same too!

## What's next for FoodFriends

The next step for FoodFriends is finding some food places and some "friends" (volunteer organizations) that want the food! (i.e expanding our userbase)
